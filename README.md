Smoothie - a lightweight and modular JavaScript library
=======================================================

**Important notice:** Smoothie is obsolete and will be replaced by [Tarp.require](https://github.com/letorbi/smoothie/tree/tarp)
on January 31 2018. Tarp.require is a vastly improved version of Smoothie, so I
recommend to use this one once the switch has been done. Please read [the
migration documentation](https://github.com/letorbi/smoothie/blob/master/doc/migration.md)
for further information.

Well, I guess it will still take some time until this repository here contains
a whole library, but I'm working on it ;)

Right now it only contains my implementation of the CommonJS module
specification. More information can be found in my post at Pixel vs. Bytes:

Smoothie is licensed as open source under the LGPL v3.
